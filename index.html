                    </h1>
                    <p>Muhammad Ali (1942-2016) was an American former heavyweight champion boxer and one of the
                        greatest sporting figures of the 20th century. An Olympic gold medalist and the first fighter to
                        capture the heavyweight title three times, Ali won 56 times in his 21-year professional career.
                        Ali’s outspokenness on issues of race, religion and politics made him a controversial figure
                        during his career, and the heavyweight’s quips and taunts were as quick as his fists. Born
                        Cassius Clay Jr., Ali changed his name in 1964 after joining the Nation of Islam. Citing his
                        religious beliefs, he refused military induction and was stripped of his heavyweight
                        championship and banned from boxing for three years during the prime of his career. Parkinson’s
                        syndrome severely impaired Ali’s motor skills and speech, but he remained active as a
                        humanitarian and goodwill ambassador.</p>

                        A member of various street gangs at an early age, Tyson was sent to reform school in upstate New

                        <br>
                        At the reform school, social worker and boxing aficionado Bobby Stewart recognized
                        his boxing potential and directed him to renowned trainer Cus D’Amato, who became his legal
                        guardian. 
                        <br>
                        Tyson compiled a 24–3 record as an amateur and turned professional in 1985.</p>
