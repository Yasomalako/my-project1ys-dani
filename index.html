            <b><p class="px-5">Muhammad Ali (1942-2016) was an American former heavyweight champion boxer and one of the
                greatest sporting figures of the 20th century.
                <br> 
                An Olympic gold medalist and the first fighter to
                capture the heavyweight title three times, Ali won 56 times in his 21-year professional career.
                <br>
                Ali’s outspokenness on issues of race, religion and politics made him a controversial figure
                during his career, and the heavyweight’s quips and taunts were as quick as his fists. Born
                Cassius Clay Jr., Ali changed his name in 1964 after joining the Nation of Islam. Citing his
                religious beliefs, he refused military induction and was stripped of his heavyweight
                championship and banned from boxing for three years during the prime of his career. 
                <br>
                Parkinson’s
                syndrome severely impaired Ali’s motor skills and speech, but he remained active as a
                humanitarian and goodwill ambassador.
