                    Faster progress and more individual attention with a customized approach to reaching your goals:
                    Focus on boxing skills, strength/circuit training, or find the optimal combination of the two.

                    counter punching, defensive drills, and more.
                    If you are training for a fight or just want to hit someone (even if you don’t want to get hit
                    back), members interested in sparring can join intermittent sparring classes or organize private
                    sessions with other members at similar skill and enthusiasm levels. If you are interested in
                    controlled/instructional sparring, let us know or join our Wednesday or Sunday Sparring class.

            <ins><h1>Muhammad Ali</h1></ins>
            <p>Muhammad Ali (1942-2016) was an American former heavyweight champion boxer and one of the
                greatest sporting figures of the 20th century. An Olympic gold medalist and the first fighter to
                capture the heavyweight title three times, Ali won 56 times in his 21-year professional career.
                Ali’s outspokenness on issues of race, religion and politics made him a controversial figure
                during his career, and the heavyweight’s quips and taunts were as quick as his fists. Born
                Cassius Clay Jr., Ali changed his name in 1964 after joining the Nation of Islam. Citing his
                religious beliefs, he refused military induction and was stripped of his heavyweight
                championship and banned from boxing for three years during the prime of his career. Parkinson’s
                syndrome severely impaired Ali’s motor skills and speech, but he remained active as a
                humanitarian and goodwill ambassador.

                York, U.S.), American boxer who, at age 20, became the youngest heavyweight champion in history.
                <br>
                A member of various street gangs at an early age, Tyson was sent to reform school in upstate New

                <br>
                At the reform school, social worker and boxing aficionado Bobby Stewart recognized
                his boxing potential and directed him to renowned trainer Cus D’Amato, who became his legal
                guardian.
                <br>
                Tyson compiled a 24–3 record as an amateur and turned professional in 1985.
