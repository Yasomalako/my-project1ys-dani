            <P>[9:51, 27.4.2022] דניאל מלדה טק: How do you win an MMA fight?
                You can win an MMA fight in several different ways. Usually, the goal is to win by either knockout or
                submission. A knockout is when you render your opponent unconscious by punching or kicking them hard
                enough.<br> Yeesh. A submission is when your opponent either physically taps your body to let you know
                that they give up or a verbal tap to the opponent or referee. If there is no knockout or submission, the
                fight will be decided by the judges who score each round. There are only a few things that aren’t
                allowed during a fight like strikes to the back of the head, eye gouging, hair pulling, etc.

            <h2> How do they score?</h2>
            MMA fights are scored based on a few criteria.<br> The most important criteria in a fight is effective
            striking and grappling. Second, effective aggression, and third, cage or ring control.<br> Rounds are scored
            out of 10 points, with the winner of a round scoring 10, and their opponent usually scoring eight or nine,
            depending on how well they performed. While it’s theoretically possible for both fighters to score 10 in the
            same round, it’s very rare as they would have had to perform with the exact same effectiveness and impact.

            How is it organized?
            Leagues
            Like other professional sports (football having the NFL and CFL, for example),<br> there are a number of
            different MMA leagues.<br> We’re guessing the first league that comes to mind for you in the UFC (Ultimate
            Fighting Championship). However, the UFC is not the only company that runs MMA fights, they’re just the
            biggest and richest (like the NFL).<br> There are several other companies like Invicta (which runs
            exclusively women’s fights…love it), Bellator and One Championship that also host MMA leagues. That said,
            UFC is considered the ‘top’ league, so it’s basically every professional fighter’s dream to be signed by
            them (because there are no teams —players get signed directly with the leagues).

            Weight Classes
            MMA fights are organized into weight classes, so you’ll hear a lot about fighters needing to<br> “make
            weight” for a fight. Often, fighters will fight in a lower weight class than their average day-to-day
            weight.<br> Why? Because they can manipulate their water weight just prior to the fight to lose a lot of
            weight quickly (like Channing Tatum in Foxcatcher).<br> Then, as soon as the athlete weighs in just before
            the fight at their lower weight (each athlete has to weigh in the day before the fight to make sure they
            meet the rules),<br> they can immediately rehydrate and fight the next day at their usual higher weight.
            This gives them a potential size advantage. And as they say, the bigger, the better.</P>
