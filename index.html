                    Often I get asked by friends and students if they should be doing Weight Training for MMA on top of
                    sparring, rolling, hitting pads etc. My answer is always yes. The next question is always, “what is
                    a good weight training routine for MMA?”. So here is a simple but effective weight training routine
                    for MMA mixed martial arts. This routine is not only great for Weight Training for MMA but also will
                    supplement your technical training in Muay Thai kickboxing, Krav Maga, BJJ Brazilian Jiu Jitsu, and
                    Kali. Weight training in general is important for health and fitness. When you’re stronger and have
                    a great weight lifting routine included in your physical activity, all areas of your life will
                    benefit (mental health as well as physical health).
                    <br>
                    There are 3 strength workouts that require at least 1 day of rest in between. For example you could
                    do workout 1 on Monday, rest Tuesday, workout 2 on Wednesday, rest Thursday, and workout 3 on
                    Friday.
                    <br>
                    Workout 1
                    <br>
                    Squat – 3 sets of 5
                    <br>
                    Bench Press – 3 sets of 5
                    <br>
                    Rows – 3 sets of 5
                    <br>
                    Workout 2
                    <br>
                    Deadlift – 3 sets of 3
                    <br>
                    Military Press – 3 sets of 5
                    <br>
                    Pullups – 3 sets of 10
                    <br>
                    Workout 3
                    <br>
                    Step-ups – 3 sets of 10
                    <br>
                    Push Press or Incline Press or Dips – 3 sets of 5
                    <br>
                    Power Cleans or Power Snatches – 5 sets of 3
                    <br>
                    This is a great routine for Weight Training for MMA but it can be tweaked, changed, or completely
                    redone to fit your fitness and martial arts goals. It is common to split the 3 workouts into a
                    pushing day (chest), a pulling day, (back), and of course leg day. The workout above mixes up the
                    muscle groups so you are not totally destroyed and unable to train the next day.
